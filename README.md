FTF Data Dump

Data has been collected from all FTFs in 2017, and organised into
individual files.

There are two formats available for each FTF data thing:
* CSV (in the .csv)
* Markdown table (in the .txt)

The .txt also contains data for that FTF (total comments, karma, average K:C).

If you want to view the data in Github, open the .csv-s.
Apparently Github supports that now, which is cool.

`all.txt` and `all.csv` contain the cumulative data for each user.

Each FTF data thing contains the following information about each user
that commented in that FTF:
* Ranking (by comment count, reversed)
* Comment count
* Karma
* K:C ratio

Karma will be a bit out, due to Reddit's vote fuzzing. Comment count may also
be a bit out out if the user has posted in any FTF within the last hour, but this
should be right in general.

If not, [contact me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=erkghlerngm44)
and I'll have a look. Also contact if you need anything else.
